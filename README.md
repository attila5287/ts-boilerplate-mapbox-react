# TypeScript Boilerplate with Mapbox React

This project demonstrates a React + TypeScript + Vite setup with Mapbox GL JS integration.

## Project Development Journey

Started by cloning the [Vercel Vite React TypeScript starter kit](https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/framework-boilerplates/vite-react) as our foundation. 

For the initial implementation, used the Map component from the [Mapbox React-JS tutorial](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/simple-map/) as a "Hello World" example. However, encountered several TypeScript errors that needed to be resolved:

- Fixed ref type annotations for proper TypeScript support
- Added null checks for React refs
- Removed unused imports
- Properly typed the Mapbox GL JS integration

After resolving the local TypeScript issues, encountered additional errors during the Vercel deployment process. These were also successfully fixed, and the project is now live at:
